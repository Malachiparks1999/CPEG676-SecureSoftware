# Project 2: Speedrun Challenges Growth Report

I want to know about your growth. Even if the project is a group project I want each person to tell me the following:

1. What is your project?
2. Give me step by step instructions to get it running. (This might involve sharing execute ability on a cloud9 space with 'AndyNovo'.)
3. How many hours did you work on this?
4. List your "a-ha" moments. (When something useful clicked for you.)
5. What is your overall impression of the experience? Which skills do you want to keep in your future?
<br><br>
   
**1. Describe the timeline of the project: HOW MANY HOURS DID YOU SPEND, when did you start, bottlenecks you faced, etc.**

> *__Hours Spent:__* 20 hrs max </br>
> *__Started:__* First day I was able to start project2 I did </br>
> *__Bottlenecks:__*
>   * Write What Where was my major bottle neck, I get the concept put still suck at perfect execution
>   * Ensuring formatting was correct `p32 or p64` along with padding
>   * Scanning each binary for vulnerabilities, weaknesses, etc </br>

> *__Timeline:__*
>   1. *Week 1:* Challenges 00-06
>   2. *Week 2:* Break from project
>   3. *Week 3:* Challenges 07-11
>   4. *Week 4:* Break from project
>   5. *Week 5:* Challenges 12-15

**2. How did you meaningfully grow as a developer from the project (if you did)?**

> Not much of development but being able to debug and find the solution is always improved with CTF style PWNing or REVing. Taking the Rev and Pen Test class in Fall '21 really opened my interest into this and I still loved every minute of it.

**4. Were there any "A-HA" insights that you'll carry with you into future work?**

> * Working with pwntools (had this on my bucklist of tools to learn)
> * Refined my understanding of shellcode
> * Solidified calling conventions of 32/64 bit
> * Solidified understanding of GOT/PLT exploits
> * Grew to understand how to utilize leaks

**5. Are you proud enough of the work that you'd use it in a job interview/portfolio? If not, what would you change to make it that way?**

> Honestly I love CTF style problems from Web to Pwn to Rev. I am hoping to start a Youtube channel, similar to what we had to do with the Web Bingo Board to show my understanding of problems and utilize on a resume.
