CPEG476-010: Secure Software Design


Modulus:
	Moves address at edi into eax, the return pointer
	Convert Doubleword to Quadword (extends sign bit of return register) ---> Move the remainder of division into edx
	Sign divid then move remainder, the answer into return register eax

s
Mod 13
	Move sign extension into 64 bit rax register
	Move sign extension into edx to preserve
	Multiply sign extension, store in rax, times crazy large number
	Shift remainder right, 31 bits
	Shift return register 34 bits
	Subtract edx from eax
	Load in parameter a
	Repeat steps for full division return the remainder of the division


Mod 64
	Move sign of edi into ex
	Shigt edx right arithmetically, to keep alter sign of number, then logical shift to divide once more
	Load in effective address of a
	and value of a with 63 to produce dividing number
	Subtract higher number from 13 to get remainder
	Return eax
