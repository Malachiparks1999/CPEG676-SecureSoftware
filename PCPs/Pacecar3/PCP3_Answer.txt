CPEG476-010: Secure Software Design


Modulus:
	Divides the dividend by divsor in 32 bits then moves the remainder into eax, return register to
	ensure correct value is returned.

Mod 13:
	Shifts the two numbers to ensure they are small enough to divide eachother by. Then loads in a
	and subtracts it, then moves result to eax to return.

Mod 64: 
	Loads in potential large number, and shifts it logically and arethmtically. From there ands
	variable a with 63 to get remainder of modulus. From there does a subtraction to bit correct
	and returns in eax
