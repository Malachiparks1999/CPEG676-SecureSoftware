Linking a specific glibc. Follow the notes from class22 with the house_of_spirit demo from https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap, click the arrow on the table to 
get to the interactive demo (and type run) to see what success looks like (the predicted address emerging from malloc). 
Now grab the source code for house_of_spirit.c and compile it using gcc, no special flags. Use patchelf and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to get that same behavior on your box, 
then use pwntools to get the same behavior in python. Take a screenshot of you correctly linking in the 2 methods.
