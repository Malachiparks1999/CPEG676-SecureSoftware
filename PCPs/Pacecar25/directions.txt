(skipping one for alignment) The bins: make a DM to me in which you explain the 5 basic bin types (small, large, unsorted, fast, tcache). 
Which ones are singly linked? What is the difference between tcache and fastbins? 
How do you end up in the smallbins for sizes that are also tcache and fastbin sizes? 
This is "short answer" style, really to know that you can think casually about it. 
So if you are rushing through, copy pasting, or just trying to knock out a HW then stop, and ask yourself if you could explain it at a whiteboard to a friend. 
Once you think could whiteboard it, then hit me up.
