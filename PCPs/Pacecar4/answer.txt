How I arrived at the answer

1. r2 -Ad <filename>
2. s main
3. Vpp (Visual Mode)
4. Set break points, looking for comparisions
5. Renamed variables I knw like user input
6. Set breakpoint when comparing my string to answer
7. Realized var_54 is a counter, and set to stop at 25 bytes
	Strings above of random junk above are 24 bytes with a null byte
	XOR'd with i

Random String = nhlie~q4dj:fiRz?Oc!e'{qj
